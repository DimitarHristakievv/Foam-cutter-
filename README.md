This project is a trial version and it is not complete yet. 
If you don't have the necessary technical skills in CAD it may be not easy to comprehend the assembly process. 
Do not attempt to manufacture anything, such as this version is 01 and it will be subject to various modifications.
If you attempt to do so you should know that the plate parts are made from plywood. 
They are glued together and they will be treated with epoxy resin and paint so they will be solidified as one.
The distances between Al profiles are subject to adjustment with nuts.
Assembly drawings will be released with the proper spacing along with the electrical wiring. 
The design is missing a top profile that connects the 2 verticals.It is optional and I prefer not to have a connection profile on top because the two verticals have to be independent.
All the links will be released along with the 3D parts in Grab cad.
It runs on Match 3 board and the motors are Nema 23.The motor plates are adapted for NEMA 17 and the machine could fit 2 sizes of  gear rolls and belts for which I will provide information in the future.
